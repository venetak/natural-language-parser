# Natural Language Parser in Typescript

The purpose of this tool is to create an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) from a sentence in English. You ca use the generated abstract syntax tree to analyze the semantics of the sentence and used them as input for a natural language interpreter.

# Structure

The language grammar is defined in `grammar/BNF.txt` - it in [Backusâ€“Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form). The actual implementation is an Object Oriented approach using TypeScript classes.
